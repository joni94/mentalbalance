      Mental balance means being in a state of equilibrium of your own mind. It doesn’t necessarily mean all brain activity is completely diminished, but it does mean you’re in control of your actions by letting go of your thoughts and impulses. I have a firm conviction everyone can reach this with a natural approach, free from medication and other substances. </br>
    </br>
      Nowadays, medication is applied too frequently for minor problems and is often evaluated on its short term effects. In my eyes, applying medicines should only be done when it’s absolutely necessary; especially when it comes to treating neurological symptoms. Medication might be an easy way to produce a temporary balance in your brain, but it’s not always the right treatment. </br>
    </br>
      In this blog a natural approach is applied for treating mental imbalances to gain control of yourself. You’ll find more balance by yourself, which gives you the confidence that you’re in control. The methods used are not new and have proven themselves already. There are only a few downsides in this approach, a natural approach requires time, patience, effort and discipline. After getting used to the method, you’ll end up enjoying these “down”-sides.  The natural approach mainly is a combination of (emotional) energy release and meditation. However, there is a great variety within energy release and meditation techniques and it’s highly personal which suits you best. This blog will help you to find the best suitable way to get grip of your own mind. The first step in doing so is to accept everything within and around you. An open mind is necessary in order to get to know your mind, see it from an objective viewpoint. Be realistic, don’t fool yourself or let your mind fool you! The better you know your mind, the better you can control or even manipulate your mind to maintain balance and control. Keep in mind, the goal is mental improvement which is reached by finding more balance. Be patient since every step in the right direction gives you more balance and control. This is a gradual step-by-step path in finding mental balance, make sure you acknowledge the small achievements in order to achieve the greater ones.
    </br> </br>
      This method requires some knowledge to evolve in wisdom. Everything told, should also be experienced by yourself from your own perspective. Don’t look for wisdom in order to achieve wisdom, keep your mind open and it will come by itself! </br>
