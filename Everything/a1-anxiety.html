    <h1>Stop identification with anxiety!</h1>

<span class="teaser-anxiety">Are you tired of your anxiety? Is it becoming a huge part of your life? The anxiety is not you, and you are not the anxiety. So let's do something about it!</span>
  </p>
</br>
<p class="intro-anxiety">
Most of us lose control when anxiety is overwhelming, you’ll act according to the fear. This is a normal response since anxiety helped us survive since ancient times. However, these days a lot of anxiety is misplaced and even unnecessary. When fear is misplaced it’s important to remain calm, otherwise it might end up in uncontrollable panic attacks, hyperventilation and who knows what else. These outbursts can do severe damage to an individual and you lose your confidence of being in control. A natural approach in controlling this misplaced fear is to stop the identification with that “anxious” sensation. To stop identification you must understand what fear is, what the identification with fear is and how to prevent identification. This article is written to give an idea of how to prevent identification with fear.
</p>

</br>

<p class="p-1">
<span class="p1">What is fear?</span> </br>
Fear is an emotion coming from our ego and so our will to survive. It has played (and is still playing) an important role in our survival. The emotion is there to keep us alert for threats that might endanger us. In ancient times the dangers were more obvious and simple, nowadays these threats are more complex and harder to identify (e.g. people can look trustworthy, but can you really trust them?). This is the reason why a lot of individuals experience unnecessary and misplaced anxiety. Fear is divided into two major responses: The biochemical response and the emotional response.
The biochemical response, or better known as the fight and flight response, is described as the natural part of anxiety. This response includes all physiological changes contributing to the actual fight or flight action. When a threat is upon us, our mind and body prepare to undergo action, an additional energy boost in the form of adrenaline comes to support the fight or flight response.
The emotional part of fear is a more personalized response, it differs for every individual. The sensations of anxiety are most of the time divided into positive or negative. Some individuals manage to experience the sensation of fear without giving it a positive or negative label, they look at it from a neutral perspective. Watching horror movies or engaging in extreme sports are examples of anxiety experiences that can get a positive label (it gives you a mental kick). However, these same experiences can be labeled negative as well, it depends on how you experience these sensations. The way you label these experiences aren’t static, this can change over time. An individual could be scared when watching horror movies when he or she was younger, but loves that sensation later in life (or the other way around). The intensity of the sensation can change as well, you can get used to the sensation. The most important part to remember is: Fear can be experienced in a positive, negative and even neutral way, realizing this is important in order to overcome your anxiety.
</p>
</br>
<p class="p-2">
<span class="p1">What is identification with fear?</span> </br>
The emotional response in anxiety has a big influence on the identification with fear. Identifying with fear means to admit and completely give in to this fear. This can be done on certain levels, but when fully identified, the fear is dominant and completely in control. Whatever anxious thought or impulse comes up, will be conducted right away. The problem is that this happens very fast and most of the times subconsciously. This doesn’t necessarily mean you can’t control this identification. The identification is still a process conducted by you, and you alone. It can be a habitual pattern (part of the trained mind), but you’re the one in charge. Do you remember a time when you were anxious but didn’t allow this anxiety to take over? This can be in a presentation, a fight, a moment in traffic or anything where anxiety was present but not in charge. You didn’t act according to your anxiety, you were in control. You were controlling your body, and you let the sensations of anxiety be there. This means you didn’t identify with your anxiety. However, the moment you give in to that fear, you eventually end up identifying with that fear. You are your fear at that given moment (or that fear is you). Whenever fear is there, identification can be avoided. This applies to all types of fear responses, but the physical symptoms of natural fear might still be present. For example: An elevated pulse rate can be present even though you’re not identifying with that fear; your hands might be shaking, but you’re not giving in to that fear. The moment you tell yourself this is anxiety is the moment the identification starts. Just let the increased pulse rate be there, without any identification (just allow it to be there). A pulse rate or any other biochemical symptom doesn’t mean you’re not in control of your mind (try not to give in right away). Prevent the identification and overcome that anxiety, even though physical symptoms can be felt. This is an enormous challenge, but you can do it with the right techniques and motivation. Believe in yourself!

<span class="p1">How can we prevent identification?</span> </br>
Going in against the process of identification with fear is hard, but everyone can learn it. For some it might be harder than for others, but even the slightest difference should be considered an improvement. Let’s first remember that there is nothing wrong with the identification, you’re not less of a person when you do (we all do it). With this technique, it’s critical not to judge yourself when you gave (or are giving) in to fear without any form of control. You have to try to remain objective towards the fear when it’s present. Keep seeing it from a neutral perspective, which will give you an insight into what it actually is. Familiarize yourself with the feeling. No judgments toward the fear: Don’t label the fear positive or negative. Positive might seem nice, but it can turn into negative when it gets too intense. Labeling it negative will start an additional struggle within your mind (since you don’t want it to be there). This additional struggle can result in amplification of your anxiety. Instead of labeling your fear positive or negative, try to welcome the fear without judgment. The anxious feeling is there, but try not to tell yourself you're anxious. You’ll feel the symptoms like an increased pulse rate, the pressure at the chest, the agitated mind, but just let this be. There is always a part of you that just observes the sensations. Don’t worry about these symptoms, they will pass since everything is temporary. Don’t crave for more pleasant sensations, accept these unwanted and unpleasant sensations. The moment you abort these sensations you’re not accepting it, which means you’re not objective anymore. Matter of fact, when you abort these sensations you amplify the unwanted sensations (since you label them as negative). So how in the world do you remain objective towards these unpleasant sensations? This can be done with several direct and indirect approaches. Within the direct approach a few suggestions are presented, but you might find your own approach as well. Direct refers to: At the time of being anxious, this can be in an early stage or even when panicking or hyperventilating. The moment you notice anxiety you must try to stay calm, and observe what feelings are going through your mind and body. When you start giving in to anxiety (or already gave in) it’s important to let it go. This can be done with several methods, just try a few and see which helps best. Keep in mind that these methods don’t make anxiety disappear, but keeping objective will stop the identification and you’ll stay calm. This will convince you that you’re in control, even though the anxiety is there. The sight might be blurry, but you’re always in charge!
</p>
</br>
<p class="p-4">
<span class="p2">Direct methods</span> </br>
The first thing you can do when being (or getting) anxious is laying down and close your eyes, accept the physical sensations and have confidence this will pass. If this is too hard, you can record your experience. Take voice recordings or write down what you feel, for example: “The mind is agitated, always thinking about opinions of others, scared others might see me like this. I can feel my pulse rate has increased. My hands are shaking, this is hard to write down due to the trembling.” In this example, I was laying down on the bed with an intense sensation of anxiety. Laying down to remain calm and writing down the observations in between helped me out of it. Over time, you’ll gain more confidence towards your anxiety, this confidence comes from being familiar with the feeling. Being familiar will keep you calmer since you know it will pass. Some sensations can even be labeled as anxiety, but are not even contributing to the state of being anxious (this amplifies the intensity). Just writing something down, or saying something out loud can calm you down. Registration of the experiences pushes you in an observing perspective, which is necessary for overcoming your fear.
However, if the anxiety is too intense, laying down and record might not be sufficient. The mind can be too agitated and it might be hard to lay down. Whenever this happens, there is a lot of emotional energy supporting your anxiety. Even though it is possible to sit through this, another method might be easier to apply. In this approach, you will release that intense emotional energy. An example of releasing this energy is physical exercise. The intense energy of the emotion can be released by putting it into motion energy. Walking, running, push-ups, punching, throwing a ball, jumping, swimming or any other physical activity can help you to release this energy. It's important you don’t have to think while doing this activity: When running, just run somewhere; when punching, just punch, and don’t worry about your technique. The release of energy is the main purpose, don’t let anything distract you from that. When the intensity has decreased, you should sit (or lay) down and observe the sensations once more. Keep in mind that other methods can be used to release this energy as well, you might already know an effective one. It’s important that whatever you apply, let your mind go and let it roam freely. Being creative, produce, give your mind the space it needs without any restrictions. Just make sure you can’t end up with more regrets or frustrations. These frustrations can come when you start expecting things (e.g. you expect yourself to win a game or finish a song). The purpose is releasing energy, don’t get distracted from that purpose.
</p>
</br>
<p class="p-5">
<span class="p2">Indirect methods</span> </br>
The indirect method is aimed to train your mind in order to withstand unpleasant sensations. By practicing the indirect approach you’ll have a stronger mind, and it will be easier to remain calm whenever anxiety is present. There are several ways to train your mind, but the most effective way is meditation. Nowadays, meditation is a well-known definition and there is a lot of variety within the meditation techniques. So where do we start? The most important thing to consider is your goal in meditation. Most of the meditations techniques are focused on calming down the mind. With these techniques; manipulating the breath, body and mind are the main focus. All the techniques are effective in doing so and could be considered a direct approach as well. The disadvantage of this technique is that you have to think about it and maybe even have to undergo action before you calm down. For example: The moment anxiety comes, you have to consciously decide to breathe easily, or meditate and focus on this. When this works it’s amazing, but this would not work when you’re fully identified with anxiety. When fully identified you don’t have control, so putting in more input to calm down can make it worse. Applying this technique helps to calm your mind when meditating, but it might be hard to apply in the heat of the moment. When there really is a reason to stress and no time to meditate, you’ll still identify with that fear.
To learn to stay calm and in control in the heat of the moment, it’s important to zoom out from your thoughts and sensations. The sensations are still there, but you have to remain objective towards them. This can be practiced with a meditation technique as well, but slightly different from the other technique(s). Within this meditation technique, you sit and observe what your body and mind are doing. Don’t manipulate anything, just observe. The best way to start is to observe one place at first. Observe how the breath flows through the area of your nostrils and upper lip without manipulating anything. Feel the breath fall on your skin (notice the difference in temperature). If the breath is short, let it be short. If you feel any other sensations in this area like pain or itch, let it be there, don’t abort them, just feel them as they are. Try to sit still at all times and feel the sensations. Start with one spot, and once you’re feeling a lot of sensations objectively, you can move on to body scans (first on the surface). It is important to be patient, do not crave for sensations and remain absolutely objective. The first type of meditation (calming the mind down) is not wrong. This is a very effective way of calming down your mind, but the problem is that you need the time and space to do so. In the heat of the moment, you don’t have this time and space. The second technique (observe objectively) does contribute to staying in control since this technique makes you allow pleasant and unpleasant sensations without identifying with them. Instead of identifying with the feeling of anxiety, you rather observe the sensations and remain calm in the mind. Be aware that this takes some time and effort to achieve, for some longer than others. Apply this technique of meditation patiently and persistently, and you’ll gradually move towards your goal. Combining the techniques is dangerous since you have to focus on one technique only. You can use the first technique to calm down your mind and start the second technique afterward, but don’t switch from the one to the other within one mediation (this will lead to doubts and distractions which delays the progress). When you really are motivated I would recommend a Vipassana meditation course. The second technique is applied within this 10-day course. Keep in mind that a course like this requires a lot of persistence, so you should be absolutely motivated when starting this course (and don’t expect to be fully cured after). The course is given worldwide and is on a donation basis, so you decide how much it costs. Feel free to contact me for some guidance, or if you want some help in setting up a good personalized approach. Keep in mind that you have to do it yourself, someone can hand you the tools, but you’re the one who conducts.

<span class="p1">Conclusion</span> </br>
In conclusion, identification with fear has an incredible influence on the intensity of your anxiety. Giving in completely can be avoided and gives you the control. When anxiety is upon you, a direct approach can be used to calm down. The goal is to release the emotional energy in your mind. Laying down, register, physical and creative exercises can help to achieve this. The indirect method can be used to calm down and observe in order to strengthen the mind. This second technique prevents identification even when the level of anxiety is very high. The meditation techniques explained might be difficult to comprehend and seeking some guidance is advised. Any type of meditation contributes in preventing identification with anxiety. You can always send me a message when looking for guidance. This trail is a long and steep one, but it gradually leads to stability in your mind, just keep on climbing. Believe in yourself!
