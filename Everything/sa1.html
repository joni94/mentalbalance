    <h1>Identification explained</h1>

<p class="intro-identification">
  Internal identification is a huge part in many mental challenges and preventing identification is necessary to overcome these challenges. This is a complex task, which can be different within every situation. Therefore, it’s absolutely necessary to understand what kind of identification is meant within these articles since it can be defined and interpreted in several ways. This article is written to give a better understanding of what identification actually means within these articles. In general, identification means: “Something that identifies a person, animal or thing.” In these articles we are more focused on personal identification: “What or where do you identify yourself with?” The meaning of identification can be divided in two major categories: external- and internal identification. This article will explain what the difference is between these two types of (personal) identification. However, there is a huge overlap between the two since external eventually can become internal. This might sound confusing, but don’t worry, the confusion will fade, just keep on reading.
</p>
<br>

<p class="p-1">
<span class="p1">External identification</span> </br>
External identification basically means identifying with something outside of your mind. In external identification, you and others can literally see and/or easily comprehend where you identify with. Several examples are: Clubs, names, music genres, groups, organizations, nationalities, subcultures and personal image. Keep in mind that several of these can have overlap with internal identification (we talk about the details later). Football hooligans are a great example of external identification since they are identifying with their club. Some of them identify lightly and briefly by just temporary cheering for their favorite team, while others literally make the club part of their lives. This shows the difference in how strong you can identify with something, make it strong enough and it might become an internal identification. </br> </br>
External identification has to do with the will to identify with something. You can work for a certain organization without identifying with their name. However, when being proud or satisfied, identification most of the time takes place. Someone could be an employee at Coca-cola and love to talk about it since it’s a famous brand. Others might hide that they work for the Coca-cola factory because they’re ashamed to work for them. So keep in mind: Being part of something doesn’t mean you’re identifying with it. Others might identify you with this, but in these articles we talk about where you identify yourself with (personal identification). This can be influenced by others, but is not determined by others.
</p>
</br>
<p class="p-2">
<span class="p1">Internal identification</span> </br>
When something is on your mind and you’re immediately identifying with this without holding back, it can be called internal identification. Internal identification is identification with something within your mind. Examples of possible internal identification features are: Thoughts, Emotions, Will and a strong image of yourself. A few of these features are explained one by one. </br> </br>
First of all, identification with thoughts. When thoughts come up in your mind, you observe and acknowledge them. This doesn’t mean that these thoughts you observe are your convictions. Thoughts come and go at any moment of the day (for some more than others). You identify with these thoughts the moment you’re convinced these thoughts are the truth. A good example is when someone might be lying to you. You might already have thought about the possibility that the person is lying to you, but you didn’t identify with this thought. You probably told yourself: “I’m thinking too much, I should trust this person”. However, after a while you get more reasons to believe this person is lying (e.g. the story this person is telling doesn’t add up, or might be different every time you’re asking about it). At some point, your thoughts cross a threshold and you’re convinced the lie is real. At this moment, you’ll completely identify with this thought. Even though the individual might not be lying, the thought is there and you are convinced it’s the truth.
</br> </br>
In the next example we talk about identification with emotions. This might be difficult to comprehend since a lot of people fully identify with emotions the moment they are sensed (subconsciously). A fun fact is: The emotion can be there, but that doesn’t mean you have to identify with it. The easiest way to explain this is with the emotion of fear. We all experience anxiety, but we don’t always identify with anxiety. Do you remember a moment where you really were scared but didn’t give in to that fear? You could feel physical symptoms caused by the anxiety but you never gave in to that anxiety.
A clear example is while giving a presentation: You probably were nervous, but you didn’t let those nerves get the best of you. You didn’t let that anxious feeling take over, you just gave the presentation even though you were anxious. So not identifying with your emotion basically means feeling the emotion, have the physical symptoms and thoughts of that emotion, but not letting it rule your mind. You’re still able to make rational decisions and observe whatever is going on. You’re still in charge and the emotion stays in the background.
</br></br>
The last example we cover is Identification with will which is hard to comprehend as well. Some individuals are oblivious to the fact they continuously identify with their own will. This isn’t crazy since full identification with will means that you do whatever comes up in your mind, you do whatever you want. You comply with your ego and you can’t zoom out from it (at least not at that moment). Addictions are great examples to explain this feature: When addicted to cigarettes, you tell yourself you need a cigarette at some point. Everyone knows this necessity is just part of the addiction, but you fail to see that at that given moment (or you don’t want to see it). It’s a feeling that you interpret as needing a cigarette and thinking about it only strengthens that feeling. The nicotine plays part in this as well, but it’s not as strong as your own will (but you probably tell yourself it’s caused by the nicotine). The moment you quit smoking, you’ll be fighting that will and that identification will become weaker and weaker (if you really overcome the addiction). It’s possible that you want something, but you don’t identify with your will, you control yourself and let that will and feeling be as it is. When identified with your will you tell yourself, "I really want" or "I need". When not fully identified you rather say, "I’d like to". Those people who always got what they wanted have an incredibly hard time to prevent identification with their will. Identification with the will is the foundation of every addiction, but we talk about this more in a separate article.

<p class="p-3">
<span class="p1">The overlap</span> </br>
In this part, we talk about the overlap between internal and external identification. When an external identification is very strong, it becomes an internal identification. When you love a football club with all your heart, it might become part of you. You’ll definitely identify with this since it became part of you. Keep in mind that this effect can be reversed as well!
</br> </br>
Personal image is a great example in explaining the overlap of the two types of identification. The personal image basically consists of external features: Name, nationality, favorite club, subculture, music genre, groups, and organizations. These external features become internal whenever the identification is strong. For most people, name and nationality are internal by default. “I am John Doe and I am from the United States of America, no doubt about it.” However, the name and nation are still external features, because they are given names to something or someone. This individual is identifying with this name and nation but on a deep subconscious level. Therefore, the identification became internal.
Identification with a subculture can become internal as well. At some point in life, you might be convinced you love a certain type of subculture and you want to be part of it. In the beginning, this is not a strong identification, but after years it will become part of you. You will identify with this subculture without thinking about it. Of course, this habit of doing so might fade if you grow over the conviction that this subculture is where you belong. So even a strong and internal identification can be temporary.
</br> </br>
External identification can become internal in multiple ways. When you are a police officer, you first might just do the job, but later it becomes your life. When you smoke cigarettes, you might just smoke at first, but later you’ll identify yourself as a smoker. When you’re a football player, you first just play, but after a while you’ll identify yourself as a real football player. All these things can be reversed as well, even the identification with your name.

<span class="p1">Conclusion</span> </br>

We talked about the different types of identification, internal and external. External basically means identification with something external to your mind (e.g. Club, name, subculture). Internal means identification with something inside your mind (e.g. thoughts, emotions). External can become internal when the identification is really strong, but this effect can be reversed as well. In the upcoming articles we talk about preventing identification with internal features like thoughts and emotions. Preventing Identification with will, emotion and thoughts will have a significant effect in overcoming mental challenges.
