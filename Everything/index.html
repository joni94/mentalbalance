<p class="about-me1">
Hello and welcome to my blog, my name is Joost and I am a 26-year old Dutch guy who works in Thailand. I grew up in a small village in the North of the Netherlands in the district of Groningen. I’ve been researching life since a young age: At an age of four I remember to tell classmates of me that you could always ask, “what is this?” , even when the object is already defined. I decided to drop the question since no one seemed to understand me until much later in life. </br> </br>
When I was 11-years old I moved to a different village, where I started a new life. Soon, I wasn’t interested in my old life anymore as I met dozens of new people. These people were older and more rebellious and I did everything to blend in. Meanwhile, I got to high school and basically had the same tactic there: Change yourself in order to blend in.  I became quite rebellious and got diagnosed with ADHD, I had trouble ignoring impulses and had a lack of focus. Nevertheless, I got attention from the “cool” kids and that is what I wanted. I had to go to several instances to talk with youth psychiatrists and youth psychologists. At first, I got prescribed medication in order to improve my behavior. This wasn’t working as I spend 3 months trying several kinds of medication. It resulted in feeling ill, losing weight and losing too much energy. It got me quiet in class but it didn’t really help me so I decided to drop it. After that, I got to talk with a youth psychologist who thought me how to reflect from a more objective viewpoint. This is where I started to reflect myself from different perspectives, which was more effective than the medicines. However, even though there was improvement, I still had and developed bad habits. I kept on reflecting myself but these habits got the best of me for years; ending up in experiencing deep depressions. I got stuck in a pattern I hated and wasn’t able to accept reality nor myself. After high school I didn’t know what to do with my life. I started a study, joined the Navy but quit both since I was craving for that old habitual life of mine. 2 years after high school I started another study which I managed to finish with a few set-backs.
</br> </br>
In the first-year of my study I traveled to Japan, where I got introduced with meditation. My mother always told me about mindfulness, but I always called it “mind foolishness” until that moment. During traveling I read a book called “Everyday zen” from Charlotte Joko Beck. I met a Japanese guy who has meditated since a young age.  He told me about it and gave me a brief guided mediation. This was the moment where I realized what meditation can do and decided to take it more serious. This was the moment where I started looking for a balanced mind in a natural way. From that moment on I started meditation with guided meditations, attended Zen-courses, mindfulness, retreats, Tai-Chi and did a Vipassana retreat in Malaysia. However, I did realize only meditation wasn’t sufficient for my restless “monkey” mind. I did lose discipline a couple of times, resulting in falling back in old habits, but I always found the way back to the spiritual path. I experienced several methods to release some “emotional” energy in order to calm down that restless mind.

Accepting everything including unpleasant sensations and the parts you hate about yourself is the most important step in order to create a more balanced mind. From that acceptance you’ll start observing without judgment, which shows you a perspective of how things really are. Going back to this objective perspective has to be done over and over again as the smallest distraction can lead you astray. The ego creates an illusion resulting in selective perception. This selective perception strengthens that illusion making it a vicious cycle.  Realizing this helps to acquire wisdom to stay in control of your own mind and find balance whenever there is imbalance. This balance is something you have to achieve over and over again. I started this blog to give you some tools to follow a natural approach to find balance yourself. I don’t see Buddha, but this approach helped me to find and maintain balance within my restless “monkey” mind.
